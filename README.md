## Introduction

This website was developed as a personal project to practice and solidify my HTML and CSS skills.  It simulates a training institute website, offering information about courses, contact details, and online application options. The design prioritizes responsiveness, ensuring a consistent user experience across various devices, from desktops to mobile phones. The project incorporates various CSS techniques, including Flexbox for layout, Grid for structuring sections, animations to enhance user engagement, and hover effects for interactive elements.  While the content is placeholder text, the structure and styling provide a solid foundation for a real-world training institute website.
